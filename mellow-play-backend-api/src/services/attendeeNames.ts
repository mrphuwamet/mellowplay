/**
 * Who is actually coming, according to the registration form.
 *
 * A form-based registration can ask outright who will attend — a
 * family_member_picker with `config.role` of 'child' or 'adult'. When it does,
 * that answer is the attendee, not the child the seat happens to be booked
 * under. The two are often the same person and quietly diverge when they are
 * not: on live data, four bookings had been corrected in the registration and
 * one of them had the check-in roster calling out the MOTHER's nickname while
 * the child who came was somebody else entirely.
 *
 * The booking list and the scanner card already led with the form's answer.
 * The roster on the check-in screen did not, because it read HD_Profiles and
 * nothing else — so an edit changed one screen and not the other. This is that
 * resolution written once, for every screen to share.
 *
 * Bulk on purpose: a roster asks about a whole round at once, and one query per
 * row would be sixty round trips to render one list.
