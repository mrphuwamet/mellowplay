 * says the payment is confirmed. Sending the second wording for the first
 * event would be telling a person their money is settled when nobody has
 * looked, which is exactly the sentence they would quote back later.
 *
 * Sent from the same binding, sender and theme as every other email here, so

 * A form with an email field answers the question by itself: the first such
 * field holding an address is the recipient, and if every one of them is
 * blank there is no recipient — rather than quietly falling through to an
 * address someone typed into a notes box.
 *
 * The two fallbacks below it are for forms built before the field type
 * existed: a `receiptEmail` flag left on a text field, then the first answer
 * anywhere on the form that looks like an address.
